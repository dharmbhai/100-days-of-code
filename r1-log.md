# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [@dharmbhai Dharmesh Shah]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge to learn Python using SoloLearn App. Started on [June 04, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Created a GitHub Profile.
Learnt how to do a Pull Request and Merge to Master  
Also how to Fork a Repository (Like  I did from /kallaway/100-days-of-code
Still figuring out how to show case my progress and code.

Notes:
When the Python console displays a string, it generally uses single quotes. The delimiter used for a string doesn't affect how it behaves in any way.



You can sum up everything in three rules for naming Variables:

1: variable names can contain only letters, numbers and underscores (the only allowed special character)
2: variables cannot start with a number
3: variables cannot be named as special words that Python uses for something else. Those words are called special characters, and this prevent the user from making confusion. The words 'True' and 'False' are Boolean operands keywords, so neither of them can be the name of a variable.
Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the uppercase version of 'true' and 'false' can be assigned to values.

In-place operators allow you to write code like 'x = x + 3' more concisely, as 'x += 3'. 
The same thing is possible with other operators such as -, *, / and % as well.
