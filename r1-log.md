# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [@dharmbhai Dharmesh Shah]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge to learn Python using SoloLearn App. Started on [June 04, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Created a GitHub Profile.
Learnt how to do a Pull Request and Merge to Master  
Also how to Fork a Repository (Like  I did from /kallaway/100-days-of-code
Still figuring out how to show case my progress and code.

Notes:
When the Python console displays a string, it generally uses single quotes. The delimiter used for a string doesn't affect how it behaves in any way.



You can sum up everything in three rules for naming Variables:

1: variable names can contain only letters, numbers and underscores (the only allowed special character)
2: variables cannot start with a number
3: variables cannot be named as special words that Python uses for something else. Those words are called special characters, and this prevent the user from making confusion. The words 'True' and 'False' are Boolean operands keywords, so neither of them can be the name of a variable.
Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the uppercase version of 'true' and 'false' can be assigned to values.

In-place operators allow you to write code like 'x = x + 3' more concisely, as 'x += 3'. 
The same thing is possible with other operators such as -, *, / and % as well.

### R1D2 06June2018
PRogressed with learning conditional statements, Operators and string Operations
Here  are my scratch notes
Boolean and Comparisions
== equals logics 2==3 gives false as 2 is different from 3
!= equals illogics 2 != 3 gives true
>= / > / <= / < indicates something larger, smaller  or equals something else
python compares integers and strings too.
"too">"to" is true as 3 letters is more than 2 letters.
"sea"<"tea" is true as t comes after s in the alphabetical order.

Indentation
"Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.
Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively."

I share it because I started using tabs for indentation and I found out it can be really problematic. I got back to this lesson just to warn others from the beginning!

if 2 * 2 == 8: (<--note: :)
      print("if")
else: (<--note: :)
      print("else")

#############
if num == 5:
   print("Number is 5")
elif num == 11: (<--note: & elif)
   print("Number is 11")
elif num == 7:
   print("Number is 7")
else:
   print("Number isn't 5, 11 or 7")

R1D3 07June2018
While Loops
break and continue 
list can have any data type. index starts with 0. if you need to access the last index of the list, use -1
list operations ( "in" "not in")
